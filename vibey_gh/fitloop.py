"""The fit calculus as a running control loop, with its reasoning kept (#263).

`fit` measures both sides and decides once. This closes the loop around it: every
completed operation feeds its own timing back, the constants are re-fitted from a
rolling window rather than assumed, and **every decision is written down with the
inputs that produced it** — so an admission can be explained months later instead of
being re-derived from a shrug.

Three properties are the point.

**Self-adjusting.** The window is bounded, so the estimate tracks what the machine is
doing *now*. A model that was swapped out, a machine that gained free memory, a run of
unusually large payloads — each moves τ and s within a few operations rather than
being averaged into irrelevance by history.

**Reconstructible.** The journal records the whole basis of each decision: the
projection, the constants, the queue, the payload, the deadline. Recording only the
verdict would leave "why was this deferred?" unanswerable, which is the state doctrine
7 exists to prevent.

**Bounded.** This loop does not resize swap, and that is deliberate rather than
unfinished. #263 asks for headroom to be scaled autonomously; growing paging space is
an irreversible act on somebody's machine, and the floor rule puts irreversible acts
in a human's hands. So the loop computes exactly what to change, says so loudly, and
stops there. `recommendation()` is the output; acting on it is the operator's.

At the floor — a model the machine cannot host at all — it stops adjusting and says
so in plain words, in under one service time, which is what doctrine 10's
clarification requires of it.
