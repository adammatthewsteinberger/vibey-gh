"""Promote the integration branch to the release branch.

This is the half of the flow that was missing. The merge train fills the integration
branch; something has to move it to the release branch, and doing that by hand is how a
release ends up on the wrong branch — or how an unbumped version publishes nothing.

Three things it gets right that a hand-written workflow usually does not:

**It compares by CONTENT, not by commit count.** The release branch is rebase-merged, so
its commits are rewritten copies with different SHAs; the integration branch will always
look "ahead" by some number of commits even when the two trees are identical. A diff
between them is the only honest test of whether there is anything to release.

**It derives the version before opening anything.** A PyPI upload with `skip-existing`
turns an unbumped promotion into a green run that publishes nothing, silently. `none` is a
legitimate answer — docs and CI changes reach no installed user — and the promotion still
proceeds; it just does not publish.

**It waits for the checks.** A pull request opened seconds ago has no results yet, and
merging blind is how a red build reaches the release branch.
