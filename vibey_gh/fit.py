"""The fit calculus (#263): both sides of the fit, measured continuously.

Doctrine 10's hardware-decomposition clarification says to read the specs of the
hardware the code actually runs on AND the specs of the model actually wanted on
it — fully, honestly, in detail — then decompose work until each piece fits, down
to the floor of the lowest hardware that can run that model, and beyond the floor
to fail loudly to a human rather than silently.

This module is that clarification as a running control loop rather than a one-time
preflight. It samples both sides, keeps a rolling estimate of the two constants
that govern everything, projects whether a piece of work fits a deadline, and says
`admit`, `defer`, or `floor` with the arithmetic that justifies the answer.

The constants, measured on a live machine (24 GB, qwen2.5-coder:14b at 9.7 GB):

- **s** — effective parallelism, total generation-seconds ÷ wall seconds. Measured
  at 3.1 across a six-way rung, not the 2 a naive throughput reading suggested;
  payload size, not queue depth, governed wall time.
- **τ** — service time, a *distribution* (58s–206s observed) that scales with
  payload size, so it is estimated as `base + rate × bytes` from what actually ran.

Everything else follows: `wall(N) ≈ W(N)/s`, and a job fails when its projected
wait plus service exceeds the caller's deadline.

**This module never resizes swap by itself.** It computes what headroom the
projection needs and reports it; growing paging space is an irreversible act on
someone's machine, and Article III's bounded delegation puts that in a human's
hands. `recommendation()` is the output; acting on it is the operator's call.
