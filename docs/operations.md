# Operations

Required repository secrets are `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `AUTOMERGE_TOKEN`; PyPI/TestPyPI
use trusted publishing environments. Enable Actions write permissions, PR creation,
GitHub Pages via Actions, Packages, Releases, and Deployments. Use workflow dispatch for
recovery. Inspect exact run and head SHA before retrying. Never solve a blocked release by
deleting, force-pushing, weakening a gate, or switching production to TestPyPI.

When Conventional Commits rewrites a topic branch, synchronize the local checkout before
new work. Preserve unpushed work first, then use `git fetch origin` and rebase it onto the
new remote head; if there is no unpushed work, reset the local topic branch to its explicit
`origin/<branch>` ref. Never run either operation against `develop` or `main`. The workflow
has no per-run bypass: correct the commit locally when a fork or merge-containing branch
cannot be repaired automatically. Disable the managed workflow only through reviewed
`[install].workflows` configuration, which makes the policy change visible to CI.
