"""Shared fixtures.

The suite must behave the same on a laptop and inside GitHub Actions. Actions exports a
number of variables that the code under test reads, and a test that silently changes
behaviour because of one of them is worse than a failing test: it hides a branch and,
in this case, writes into the real job summary.
